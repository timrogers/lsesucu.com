<p>As well as being at the Freshers Fayre, we'll be running a number of
  events in the first few weeks of term to help you meet the rest of the CU
  and find a church.</p>

<p><b>There are plenty more events still to be announced, so watch this

<p>We all love CU, but it is no substitute for a great church.</p>

<p>Here at LSESUCU, our main purpose to know Christ and make Him known, but
  getting stuck into a church is important for growth in our personal
  relationship with God with the suppose of a diverse church family.</p>

<p>In London, we are spoilt for choice many great local choices from all
  denominations, small and large. CU members attend a variety of these, some
  of which are linked below.</p>

<p>During the first month we will host a 
  <a href="#freshers-week">church-finding picnic</a> and CU members would love
  to take you and introduce you to the churches they attend.</p>

<p>Along side Sunday services, many of these churches also have mid-week
  small-group bible studies for students - a great way to get to know
  like-minded Christians in London.</p>
