<p>We all love CU, but it's no substitute for a great church.</p>

<p>Here at LSESUCU, our main purpose is to know Christ and make Him known, but
  getting stuck into a church is important for growth in our personal
  relationship with God with the support of a diverse church family.</p>

<p>In London, we are spoilt for choice many great local choices from all
  denominations, small and large. CU members attend a variety of churches, some
  of which are linked below.</p>

<p>We'll host a church-finding picnic, and CU members would love
  to take you and introduce you to the churches they attend.</p>

<p><b>Join us on Sunday 5th October at 1pm at <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Lincoln's+Inn+Fields,+London+WC2A,+UK/@51.5159086,-0.1180306,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48761b4aa2ede35b:0x20217bc476dc0f3b?sa=X&ei=7y8pVMq9L8vgaPWmgagL&ved=0CC0Q8gEwAA">Lincoln's Inn Fields</a>.</b></p>

  small-group bible studies for students - a great way to get to know
  like-minded Christians in London.</p>
