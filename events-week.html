<p>Every year, we run our Events Week in Lent term to give people a chance to hear the Gospel on campus, with lunchtime events (with free lunch!) every day on campus plus London-wide events every evening at <a href="http://www.allsouls.org">All Souls, Langham Place</a>.</p>

<p>This year's Events Week on the theme "Rethink" runs from Monday 26th to Friday 30th January 2015.</p>
