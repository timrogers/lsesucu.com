<img src="/images/banners/cu-central.jpg" />

<p>Every Thursday night at 6 is our main CU meeting. We meet in the Faith Centre on the second floor of the Saw See Hock Building (the SU).</p>

<p>What to expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We begin by chatting over tea, coffee and biscuits and this is followed by an introduction and notices.</li>
  <li>We then have a few songs, a short message from a guest speaker on a passage from the Bible and a short time of prayer or discussion.</li>
  <li>CU Central tends to last for about an hour and a half, and we often head to the pub afterwards to carry on chatting with one another.</li>
  <li>You don’t have to be a member of the CU to join in our weekly meetings, and you are more than welcome to attend if you want to learn more about what we believe.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our annual weekend away is happening from the 21st-23rd November 2014. As students in London it can be quite hard to really get to know people, city life can be busy, and we can prioritise things other than God. For a weekend in Michaelmas Term we spend some time together as a CU somewhere green to get to know each other and God better.</p>

<p>Over the weekend we’ll have some talks from a guest speaker, some time to pray together, some fun activities, good food and lots of fun. We’ll also generally spend some time thinking and planning our <a href="#events-week">Events Week</a>.</p>

<a name="lunch-bars"><h3>Lunchbars</h3></a>

<img src="/images/lunchbar.jpg" />

<p>Throughout the year we run lunchbars, offering a talk and free lunch in a room on campus. The lunch time talks usually take the form of a question or statement about Christianity, which the speaker then engages with from the Bible.</p> 

<p>Recent talks have included: ‘Resurrection: Fact or Fiction?’ and ‘Lost and Found: Will God Welcome  Me?’.</p>

<a name="events-week"><h3>Events Week</h3></a>

<p>The Christian Union exists to share the Good News of Jesus Christ to students at LSE. This is an important task and we encourage one another to do it all year round, however once a year the CU works together in a week of significant activity.</p>

<p>We host a coffee stall and lunchbar every day during this week on campus along a theme – last year’s theme was ‘Lost’.</p>

<p>In the evenings, UCCF run excellent London wide events for all London university CUs to attend and invite their friends to. Our aim is for the week to reach as many different students as we can, in order for them to hear the best news they could ever possibly hear.</p>
