<a name="what-we-believe"><h3>What we believe</h3></a>

<img src="/images/banners/cu-central.jpg" />

<p>The ‘slogan’ of the CU is <b>“knowing Christ and making Him known”</b>. We believe that Jesus Christ, the Jesus of history, is God himself and yet it is possible to know him. We also believe that knowing Jesus is essential for life and for death, and thus is worth introducing to others. In fact, we aim to give every student at LSE an opportunity to hear and respond to the good news about Jesus.</p>

<p>How can a historical character be news to anyone? What would the content of the news be? What was Jesus about? Why is it good news…?</p>

<p>In one of the historical accounts of Jesus’ life, written by one of his close friends – John, Jesus is teaching a crowd, his topic: himself. Plain arrogant maybe? Well wait and see…</p>

<blockquote>“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died. This is the the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.” <i>(John 6:47-51)</i></blockquote>

<p>Jesus made reference to the Israelites being fed by God in the wilderness in Exodus 16 with manna from heaven. The Israelites had rebelled against God and as a result God had kept them wondering in the desert for 40 years. But God had had compassion on them and kept them alive by feeding them with manna from heaven. Bread from heaven which gave them life.</p>

<p>Israelites in the end did die, but Jesus says that if anyone eats of him the living bread “he will live forever”. What does Jesus mean? Well like the Israelites everyone has rebelled against God and is thus in danger of God’s just judgement against this rebellion. We deserve death. However just like God had compassion on the Israelites and provided them with bread to save them from death, so too God has had compassion on sinners and provided Jesus to save us from death.</p>

<p>How does this happen? Jesus answers in the passage that the bread that he gives is his flesh. Later in John we can read of Jesus willing being killed on a cross. On this cross punishment for sin was paid, Jesus died, giving his flesh, for punishment for our rebellion. And this can be for anyone.</p>

<p>But what’s all this about eating Jesus? Eating in the context on the passage isn’t physical ingestion like it was for the Israelites, Christians don’t ever physically eat Jesus. Instead when Jesus offers himself to his hearers as the bread of life, he desires for them to believe in him. Belief or, we sometimes say, faith in Jesus is how someone doesn’t die but lives forever.</p>

<p>So belief in Jesus leads to eternal life and not death. This bread was given as a free gift from heaven (God) to be received. What could possibility be better news to hear?</p>

<p>Nothing. That’s what we think anyway, which is why as a CU we care so much about sharing it with anyone who will listen.</p>
